Recent work has shown that simple linear models can outperform several Transformer based
approaches in long term time-series forecasting. Motivated by this, we propose a Multi-layer
Perceptron (MLP) based encoder-decoder model, Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE), for
long-term time-series forecasting that enjoys the simplicity and speed of linear models while
also being able to handle covariates and non-linear dependencies. Theoretically, we prove
that the simplest linear analogue of our model can achieve near optimal error rate for linear
dynamical systems (LDS) under some assumptions. Empirically, we show that our method
can match or outperform prior approaches on popular long-term time-series forecasting
benchmarks while being 5-10x faster than the best Transformer based model.
